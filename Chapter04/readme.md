### 4. Use built-in function len to find the length of the empty string.

### 5. Given variables x and y, which refer to values 3 and 12.5, respectively, use function print to print the following messages. When numbers appear in the messages, variables x and y should be used.

- The rabbit is 3.
- The rabbit is 3 years old.
- 12.5 is average.
- 12.5 * 3
- 12.5 * 3 is 37.5.

### 6. Consider this code:

​ 	​>>>   first   =   'John'​
​ 	​>>>   last   =   'Doe'​
​ 	​>>>   print(last   +   ', '   +   first)​
What is printed by this code?
```

### 7. Use input to prompt the user for a number, store the number entered as a float in a variable named num, and then print the contents of num.

### 8. Complete the examples in the docstring and then write the body of the following function:
```python
​ 	​def​ repeat(s: str, n: int) -> str:
​ 	    ​""" Return s repeated n times; if n is negative, return the empty string.​
​ 	
​ 	​    >>> repeat('yes', 4)​
​ 	​    'yesyesyesyes'​
​ 	​    >>> repeat('no', 0)​
​ 	
​ 	​    >>> repeat('no', -2)​
​ 	
​ 	​    >>> repeat('yesnomaybe', 3)​
​ 	
​ 	​    """​
```
### 9. Complete the examples in the docstring and then write the body of the following function:
```python
​ 	​def​ total_length(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
​ 	    ​""" Return the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2.​
​ 	
​ 	​    >>> total_length('yes', 'no')​
​ 	​    5​
​ 	​    >>> total_length('yes', '')​
​ 	
​ 	​    >>> total_length('YES!!!!', 'Noooooo')​
​ 	
​ 	​    """​
```
