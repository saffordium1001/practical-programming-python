### Variables rat_1_weight and rat_2_weight contain the weights of two rats at the beginning of an experiment. Variables rat_1_rate and rat_2_rate are the rate that the ratsâ€™ weights are expected to increase each week (for example, 4 percent per week).

- Using a while loop, calculate how many weeks it would take for the weight of the first rat to become 25 percent heavier than it was originally.

- Assume that the two rats have the same initial weight, but rat 1 is expected to gain weight at a faster rate than rat 2. Using a while loop, calculate how many weeks it would take for rat 1 to be 10 percent heavier than rat 2.
