### Variables side1, side2, and side3 refer to 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 
### Using string method format and those three variables, write an expression that produces ’The sides have lengths 3, 4, and 5.’

```python
side1 = 3
side2 = 4
side3 = 5

'The sides have lengths {0}, {1}, and {2}.'.format(side1,side2,side3)
```
